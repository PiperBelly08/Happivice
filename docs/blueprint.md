# **App Name**: HappiviceBoard

## Core Features:

- Service Overview: Display key metrics about the service, such as active users, usage statistics, and error rates, retrieved from a data file.
- Performance Monitoring: Provide visual representations (charts, graphs) of service performance metrics to quickly identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement, updated dynamically from an API.
- Service Monitoring: Allow the Administrator role to manage the services, set the service as rejected, accepted, processed (in-progress), and done. Here, the Administrator can also attach a payment gateway.
- Service Dashboard: Allow the User role to view and take a service in their specialized dashboard. After they take a service, they generate an invoice. This feature is integrated with the Service Monitoring feature, where updates from the Administrator can be seen on the system-generated invoice.
- Log Analysis Tool: Allows users to paste in log data to identify trends. An AI tool will read the logs and try to surface insights or patterns related to errors, performance issues, and suspicious activities, providing summaries and actionable recommendations.
- Configuration Management: Enable viewing and editing of service configurations (e.g., feature flags, API keys) using a user-friendly form.
- Alerting System: Show active alerts and notifications related to the service, such as critical errors or performance degradation, and provide options to acknowledge or resolve them. (Data for alerts will be read from a local data file.)
- User Feedback Integration: Displays user feedback collected via a third-party API, allowing admins to read recent feedback to understand user sentiments.

- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for a modern and neutral look. Suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use a consistent set of simple, outlined icons from a library like Material Icons.
- A clean, modular layout with clear sections for each feature (overview, logs, configurations, etc.)
- Subtle transitions and animations to improve user experience without being distracting.
